// The app had no application-level security headers at all: every response carried only
// what Cloudflare injects at the edge. They are set in one place, at the response
// boundary, so a new route cannot silently ship without them.
//
// Content-Security-Policy is the only non-obvious one. The theme script must run before
// first paint, so it stays inline and is allowlisted by hash rather than by a blanket
// inline allowance — a hash keeps injected script blocked, which is the point of the
// header.
//
// `style-src` carries no inline allowance, and none is possible for a style *attribute*:
// 'unsafe-hashes' covers event-handler attributes, not `style=`, so an element that sizes
// itself inline is silently dropped by the browser. Every style the app sets therefore has
// to be a class, a presentation attribute, or a runtime CSSOM assignment (which this
// directive does not govern). Two places were relying on a style attribute and now are
// not: the dashboard bar sizes in `dashboard-preview.tsx` are safelisted percent utilities
// in `app/style.css`, and the SVG card's root declares a fixed intrinsic size instead of
// `max-width`. `security-headers.test.ts` fails the build if either pattern returns.
//
// frame-ancestors is 'none' rather than the SAMEORIGIN default of X-Frame-Options: the
// dashboard has no reason to be framed, and clickjacking a session-bearing page is the
// risk being closed.
// Cloudflare's Web Analytics beacon is injected into HTML at the edge, not by this Worker,
// so it is not in the source and no hash can cover it. Leaving it blocked is the stricter
// posture but silently disables the zone's analytics — a real loss for a header whose
// purpose is to constrain this app, not to break the platform it runs on. The allowance is
// pinned to the two exact origins the beacon uses: the script it loads and the endpoint it
// reports to. It is not a wildcard, so no other third-party script becomes loadable.

// The script hash is derived from a module-level constant, so it is computed once and
// reused. Every response goes through here — including API responses, static assets and
// 304s — and rehashing per request would be pure waste. The promise is cached rather than
// the resolved value so concurrent first requests share one digest computation.
//
// Only a *successful* digest is kept. Caching the promise unconditionally would make one
// transient failure permanent: `securityHeaders()` runs on every response, so a rejected
// promise left in the cache would fail the whole site from then on, with nothing to clear
// it. Dropping the rejection lets the next request retry.
